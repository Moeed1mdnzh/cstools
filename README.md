# cstools
cstools stands for complex string tools.This is a module that i wrote by myself and it includes different options to work with strings.There are explanations under each method
and it explains what it is used for.It took me 1 month and half to complete it.I hope that this module is helpful enough.
# Files
The first file (cstools.py) is the whole module and the second file (Error.py) includes the necessary errors for this module.
